Make the most of your appointment

GPs spend an average of 8-10 minutes with each patient. Once you've got an appointment, plan ahead to make sure you cover everything you want to discuss.

Before you see the GP, write a list of problems, starting with the most important. List your symptoms, so you don’t forget them. Write down when they started and what makes them better or worse during a 24-hour period. If you have a complicated problem, ask for a longer appointment when you book.

You can bring a friend or relative if you're worried.

Be honest about what you think may be causing the problem, and don’t be embarrassed. Your doctor will have seen and heard it all before.

Be clear about what you want the GP to do, such as refer you to a specialist or prescribe a different medication. Be assertive if you need to, but always be polite. For more information, read about the specialist referrals and services your GP may recommend. 

Ask the GP to repeat and explain anything you don’t understand. If there are words you don’t understand, ask what they mean or get the doctor to write them down, so you can look them up later.
